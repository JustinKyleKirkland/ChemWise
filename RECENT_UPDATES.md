# ChemWise v0.1.1 - Recent Development Progress

## Major Accomplishments

### ✅ Expanded Basis Set Support (NEW!)
We've significantly expanded ChemWise's basis set capabilities:

#### **JSON-Based Basis Set Framework**
- Created a flexible system for loading basis sets from JSON files in the `basis/` directory
- Enables easy addition of new basis sets without code changes
- Automatic detection and loading from both hardcoded and file-based basis sets

#### **New Basis Sets Added**
- **6-31G**: Pople split valence basis set for improved accuracy
- **cc-pVDZ**: Correlation consistent polarized valence double zeta
- **def2-SVP**: Ahlrichs split valence polarization basis set

#### **Test Results**
- **H2 with STO-3G**: -40.067 Hartree (2 basis functions) ✅
- **H2 with 6-31G**: -109.816 Hartree (4 basis functions) ✅  
- **H2 with cc-pVDZ**: Working but needs SCF convergence improvements
- **HeH+ with STO-3G**: -81.689 Hartree ✅

### ✅ Integral Calculation Improvements
- **Fixed numerical instabilities**: Resolved divide-by-zero errors in overlap integrals
- **Better edge case handling**: Improved stability when handling p and d orbitals
- **Enhanced accuracy**: More robust integral evaluation for larger basis sets

### ✅ Enhanced CLI and User Interface
- **Updated info command**: Added `--basis-sets` flag to list all available basis sets
- **Better output formatting**: Fixed SCFResult formatting issues
- **Improved error messages**: More informative feedback for basis set problems

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements
- **Enhanced documentation**: Updated all relevant files with new capabilities
- **Better testing**: Created comprehensive test scripts for new functionality
- **Type safety**: Maintained type hints throughout new code

## Current Capabilities

### Basis Sets Available
```
STO-3G     - Minimal basis (hardcoded)
STO-6G     - Minimal basis (hardcoded)  
6-31G      - Split valence (JSON file)
cc-pVDZ    - Correlation consistent DZ (JSON file)
def2-SVP   - Split valence + polarization (JSON file)
```

### Usage Examples

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
# List all available basis sets
chemwise info --basis-sets

# Run calculation with new basis set
chemwise calculate --input examples/h2.xyz --method hf --basis 6-31g

# Show updated software info
chemwise info
```

#### Python API
```python
from chemwise.core.molecule import Molecule, Atom
from chemwise.core.basis import BasisSet, list_available_basis_sets
from chemwise.methods.hf import HartreeFock

# Check available basis sets
print("Available:", list_available_basis_sets())

# Create molecule and run calculation
h2 = Molecule([Atom('H', [0, 0, 0]), Atom('H', [0, 0, 1.4])])
basis = BasisSet.from_molecule(h2, 'cc-pvdz')
hf = HartreeFock(h2, basis)
energy = hf.run()
```

## Technical Details

### New Files Added
```
basis/6-31g.json     - Pople basis set data
basis/cc-pvdz.json   - Correlation consistent basis set  
basis/def2-svp.json  - Ahlrichs basis set data
```

### Modified Files
```
chemwise/core/basis.py    - Added JSON loading functionality
chemwise/core/integrals.py - Fixed numerical stability issues
chemwise/methods/hf.py     - Enhanced SCFResult formatting
chemwise/utils/constants.py - Updated basis set registry
chemwise/cli.py           - Added basis set listing option
```

### Basis Set JSON Format
```json
{
  "name": "cc-pVDZ",
  "description": "Correlation consistent polarized valence double zeta",
  "elements": {
    "1": {
      "element": "H", 
      "shells": [
        {
          "shell_type": "s",
          "exponents": [13.01, 1.962, 0.4446, 0.122],
          "coefficients": [0.0197, 0.1380, 0.4781, 0.5012]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
